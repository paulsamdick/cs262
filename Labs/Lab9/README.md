# CS 262 Monopoly Webservice

This is the data service application for the 
[CS 262 sample Monopoly project](https://github.com/calvin-cs262-organization/monopoly-project),
 which is deployed here:
          
- <https://git.heroku.com/limitless-waters-50928.git/>

It is based on the standard Heroku with Node.js tutorial.

- <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs>  

The database is relational with the schema specified in the `sql/` sub-directory
and is hosted on [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/). The database server,
user and password are stored as Heroku configuration variables rather than in this 
(public) repo.

You can follow the links to the database:
